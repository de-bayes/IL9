## Mike Simmons

### VERIFIED ✓
- **Title**: Illinois State Senator
- **Background**: First openly LGBTQ+ person and first Ethiopian-American to serve as Illinois State Senator (2021) ✓
- **Legislative Accomplishments**:
  - Passed Jett Hawkins Act banning hair discrimination ✓ ([Source](https://www.senatormikesimmons.com/en/news/press-releases/39-simmons-bans-hairstyle-discrimination-with-jett-hawkins-act))
  - Key leader in Patient and Provider Protection Act protecting gender-affirming care (signed January 2023) ✓ ([Source](https://www.senatormikesimmons.com/news/press-releases/150-simmons-advocates-for-the-protection-of-gender-affirming-health-care))

### CLARIFICATION NEEDED
Current bio says "passing the Jett Hawkins Act banning hair discrimination and protecting gender-affirming care" — this makes it sound like one act did both. The Jett Hawkins Act was about hair discrimination. Gender-affirming care protections came from separate legislation (Patient and Provider Protection Act).

### RECOMMENDATION
Revise to separate these two accomplishments clearly.
